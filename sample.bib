abstract = {In this paper I compare the expressive power of several models of concurrency based on their ability to represent causal dependence. To this end, I translate these models, in behaviour preserving ways, into the model of higher dimensional automata (HDA), which is the most expressive model under investigation. In particular, I propose four different translations of Petri nets, corresponding to the four different computational interpretations of nets found in the literature. I also extend various equivalence relations for concurrent systems to HDA. These include the history preserving bisimulation, which is the coarsest equivalence that fully respects branching time, causality and their interplay, as well as the ST-bisimulation, a branching time respecting equivalence that takes causality into account to the extent that it is expressible by actions overlapping in time. Through their embeddings in HDA, it is now well-defined whether members of different models of concurrency are equivalent.}

abstract = {Models for concurrency can be classified with respect to three relevant parameters: behaviour/ system, interleaving/noninterleaving, linear/branching time. When modelling a process, a choice concerning such parameters corresponds to choosing the level of abstraction of the resulting semantics. In this paper, we move a step towards a classification of models for concurrency based on the parameters above. Formally, we choose a representative of any of the eight classes of models obtained by varying the three parameters, and we study the formal relationships between them using the language of category theory.}

Restricted to the domain of finitely branching, concrete, sequential processes, most semantics found in the literature that can be defined uniformly in terms of action relations coincide with one of these eleven. Several testing scenarios, motivating these semantics, are presented, phrased in terms of `button pushing experiments' on generative and reactive machines. Finally nine of these semantics are applied to a simple language for finite, concrete, sequential, nondeterministic processes, and for each of them a complete axiomatization is provided.",

Such paths are equipped with a natural arc length which moreover is shown to be invariant under directed homotopies. D-paths up to reparametrization (called traces) can thus be represented by arc length parametrized d-paths. Under weak additional conditions,it is shown that trace spaces in a pre-cubical complex are separable metric spaces which are locally contractible and locally compact. Moreover, they have the homotopy type of a CW-complex.",

title = "Simplicial models of trace spaces",
abstract = "Directed algebraic topology studies topological spaces in which certain directed paths (d-paths) are singled out; in most cases of interest, the reverse path of a d-path is no longer a d-path. We are mainly concerned with spaces of directed paths between given end points, and how those vary under variation of the end points. The original motivation stems from certain models for concurrent computation. So far, homotopy types of spaces of d-paths and their topological invariants have only been determined in cases that were elementary to overlook. In this paper, we develop a systematic approach describing spaces of directed paths – up to homotopy equivalence – as finite prodsimplicial complexes, ie with products of simplices as building blocks. This method makes use of a certain poset category of binary matrices related to a given model space. It applies to a class of directed spaces that arise from a certain class of models of computation – still restricted but with a fair amount of generality. In the final section, we outline a generalization to model spaces known as Higher Dimensional Automata. In particular, we describe algorithms that allow us to determine not only the fundamental category of such a model space, but all homological invariants of spaces of directed paths within it. The prodsimplical complexes and their associated chain complexes are finite, but they will, in general, have a huge number of cells and generators.",

title = "Execution spaces for simple higher dimensional automata",
abstract = "Higher Dimensional Automata (HDA) are highly expressive models for concurrency in Computer Science, cf van Glabbeek [26]. For a topologist, they are attractive since they can be modeled as cubical complexes - with an inbuilt restriction for directions´of allowable (d-)paths. In Raussen [25], we developed a new method describing, for a certain subclass of HDA, the homotopy type of the space of execution paths (d-paths) as a finite simplicial complex. Several restrictions that were made to ease the presentation in that latter paper will be removed in this article in order to make the results applicable in greater generality. Furthermore, we take a close look at semaphore models with semaphores all of arity one. It turns out that execution spaces for these are always homotopy discrete with components representing sets of “compatible” permutations. Finally, we describe a model for the complement of the execution space seen as a subspace of a product of spheres – with the aim to make the calculation of topological invariants easier and faster.",

It makes possible a uniform definition of bisimulation across a range of different models for parallel computation presented as categories. As examples, transition systems, synchronisation trees, transition systems with independence (an abstraction from Petri nets), and labelled event structures are considered. On transition systems the abstract definition readily specialises to Milner's strong bisimulation. On event structures it explains and leads to a strengthening of the history-preserving bisimulation of Rabinovitch and Traktenbrot and van Glabeek and Goltz. A tie-up with open maps in a (pre)topos, as they appear in the work of Joyal and Moerdijk, brings to light a new model, presheaves on categories of pomsets, into which the usual category of labelled event structures embeds fully and faithfully. As an indication of its promise, this new presheaf model has “refinement” operators. The general approach yields a logic, generalising Hennessy–Milner logic, which is characteristic for the generalised notion of bisimulation.}

abstract = {Pomsets have been introduced as a model of concurrency. Since a pomset is a string in which the total order has been relaxed to be a partial order, in this paper we view them as a generalization of strings, and investigate their algebraic properties. In particular, we investigate the axiomatic properties of pomsets, sets of pomsets and ideals of pomsets, under such operations as concatenation, parallel composition, union and their associated closure operations. We find that the equational theory of sets, pomsets under concatenation, parallel composition and union is finitely axiomatizable, whereas the theory of languages under the analogous operations is not. A similar result is obtained for ideals of pomsets, which incorporate the notion of subsumption which is also known as augmentation. Finally, we show that the addition of any closure operation (parallel or serial) leads to nonfinite axiomatizability of the resulting equational theory.}

  abstract  = {We show in this article that some concepts from homotopy theory, in algebraic topology, are relevant for studying concurrent programs. We exhibit a natural semantics of semaphore programs, based on partially ordered topological spaces, which are studied up to “elastic deformation” or homotopy, giving information about important properties of the program, such as deadlocks, unreachables, serializability, essential schedules, etc. In fact, it is not quite ordinary homotopy that has to be used, but rather a “directed homotopy” that does not reverse the flow of time. We show some of the essential differences between ordinary and directed homotopy through examples. We also relate the topological view to a combinatorial view of concurrent programs closer to transition systems, through the notion of a cubical set. Finally we apply some of these concepts to the proof of the safeness of a two-phase protocol, well-known and used in concurrent database theory. We end up with a list of problems from both a mathematical and a computer-scientific point of view.},
